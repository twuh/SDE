Users to sell electricity generated from solar panels, wind power, etc. to neighbors or companies.
With this technology, it is expected that the price of electricity can be affordable or cheaper if there is more electricity supply, because if you expect electricity from the government the electricity price will never go down.

On the other hand home-based electricity sellers can increase revenue from selling electricity to neighbors so that the bep of any raw material such as solar panels, wind power, etc. can become faster and more independent.

Another problem is, often the power is cut off from the center in the interior for my own area almost every day, and can damage existing electronic equipment. Want to ask for compensation but PLN can not help more because it still blames the management from the center. Want to make a dam, no matter how big our electrical system is still centered, some of these problems cannot be overcome.

The system used here is.
1. A battery that can store energy from solar panels
2. a device like kwh that can deliver electricity to neighbors
3. The token is used as a means of payment, so that people can set their own electricity prices that will be sold or bought, according to market demand and supply.
4. Blockchain system that records all buying and selling transactions.
5. Research and development to make tools that are simpler, cheaper and safer.

thank you
